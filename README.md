To run the project

Use "npm i"

after that "npm run dev"

This project represents my effort to create a web application based on the popular show "Rick and Morty" While I have worked diligently to implement the required functionality and test cases, I encountered some dependency issues that prevented the test cases from running successfully.

I want to be transparent about this. Despite the challenges, I gave my best effort to complete the assignment, which included writing test cases in React for the first time. The experience taught me a lot about React testing, and I am committed to improving my skills in this area.

Assumption: I acknowledge that there is room for improvement in terms of security. One potential enhancement is the implementation of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for improved authentication and authorization. This would enhance the overall security of the application.

I appreciate your understanding and patience as I continue to learn and grow as a developer. Constructive feedback and guidance on how to resolve the dependency issues and improve the project are always welcome.

Thank you for considering my work, and I look forward to your feedback.
